I really enjoyed working on this project. There's a unique kind of fulfilment that comes from looking at a set of requirements and instantly visualizing how everything should come together.

I was able to meet all the project requirements by following Manny’s notes, training recordings, and supplementing with content from W3Schools and a few helpful YouTube videos from different creators.

The most challenging part was setting up the foreign key relationships. I'm not entirely sure if my implementation is perfect, but I hope you enjoy reviewing it as much as I enjoyed building it.

I haven’t fully styled the project yet, I wanted to complete the core functionality as soon as possible, especially given my current circumstances. That said, I definitely plan to polish this project further and include it in my portfolio.

Thank you all for the constant support and encouragement. It means a lot!
